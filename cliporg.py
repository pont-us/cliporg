# cliporg: convert HTML text on the X clipboard to emacs org mode format.
#
# Useful when copy-pasting material from a web page into an org file.
#
# This utility reads HTML from the X clipboard, converts it to org mode
# syntax, and writes it back to the X clipboard (overwriting the original
# HTML with the org version).
#
# Requires xclip and pandoc.
#
# By Pontus Lurcock, 2022. Released into the public domain.
